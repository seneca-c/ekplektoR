\arguments{
\item{fName}{Filename of a STRING protein.links.detailed.v10.txt file.}

\item{net}{The requested network. This must be a string that exists in the
header. The default is "combined_score".}

\item{cutoffType}{one of xN, xQ or xS (see Details).}

\item{val}{A number, quantile or score appropriate to the requested cutoff
type.}

\item{taxID}{The NCBI tax ID prefix of the protein1 and protein2 IDs.
Defaults to "9606" (homo sapiens)}

\item{dropUnmapped}{Controls whether to drop records in which at least one
interactor could not be mapped to HGNC gene symbol. TRUE by default.
 by default.}

\item{silent}{Controls whether output to console should be suppressed. FALSE
by default.}

\item{writeLog}{Controls whether writing the result to the global logfile is
enabled. TRUE by default.}

a weighted, directed, simple igraph graph which is a rete gG object.

\description{
\code{importNet.STRING} imports network edges from a STRING database file,
selects the highest confidence edges, maps ENSP IDs to HGNC gene symbols, and
returns a weighted, directed igraph graph object of a rete gG type.
}
\section{Selecting edges}{

  STRING scores are p-values * 1000, rounded to
  integer. The function can retrieve  the highest scored edges according to
  three different cutoff type. Type "xN" (default: 10000) retrieves the xN
  highest scored edges. Type xQ (default 0.9) retrieves the edges with scores
  larger than the xQ quantile. Type "xS" (default 950) retrieves all edges
  with scores larger or equal to xS. If different values are requested, they
  are passed in the parameter val. To read all edges, cutoff type should be
  (the default) xN, val = Inf.
}

\section{Networks}{

  STRING "protein.links.detailed.v10.txt" files contain
  several protein networks: neighborhood, fusion, cooccurence, coexpression,
  experimental, database, textmining, and combined_score. However this
  function is not restricted to these types, but will read one network for
  which the column name is requested in the function's net parameter. This
  allows users to define their own column.
}

\section{Tax ID}{

  The taxID parameter is used as a sanity check on the file
  contents. Currently only the first data record protein IDs are checked for
  being prefixed with the tax ID. During processing all numbers and one
  period prefixed to the ENSP ID are removed.
}

\section{Console and log}{

  The taxID parameter is used as a sanity check on the
  file contents. Currently only the first data
}

\section{The gG object}{

  The function returns a rete gG object, a weighted,
  directed, simple igraph graph in which HGNC gene symbols are vertex names,
  and the edge attributes $weight hold the network scores. Graph attributes
  hold metadata; use igraph::graph_attr(gG) to return: $version: the gG
  object version; $logFile: the filename to which log information was
  written; $inFile: the input filename of STRING data; $call: the complete
  function call with expanded arguments; and $date: when the gG object was
  created.
